Now that you've created a user pool, here are some places to go next\.

Dive deep into these user pool features:
+ [Customizing the Built\-in Sign\-in and Sign\-up Webpages](cognito-user-pools-app-ui-customization.md)
+ [Adding Multi\-Factor Authentication \(MFA\) to a User Pool](user-pool-settings-mfa.md)
+ [Adding Advanced Security to a User Pool](cognito-user-pool-settings-advanced-security.md)
+ [Customizing User Pool Workflows with Lambda Triggers](cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.md)
+ [Using Amazon Pinpoint Analytics with Amazon Cognito User Pools](cognito-user-pools-pinpoint-integration.md)

For an overview of Amazon Cognito authentication and authorization cases, see [Common Amazon Cognito Scenarios](cognito-scenarios.md)\.

To access other AWS services after a successful user pool authentication, see [Accessing AWS Services Using an Identity Pool After Sign\-in](amazon-cognito-integrating-user-pools-with-identity-pools.md)\.

In addition to the AWS Management Console and the user pool SDKs mentioned previously in this section, you can also interact with your user pool profiles by using the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cognito-idp/index.html)\.
