# Getting Started with Amazon Cognito<a name="cognito-getting-started"></a>

This section describes the top Amazon Cognito tasks and where to start\. For an overview of Amazon Cognito, see [What Is Amazon Cognito?](what-is-amazon-cognito.md)\.

The two main components of Amazon Cognito are user pools and identity pools\. User pools are user directories that provide sign\-up and sign\-in options for your web and mobile app users\. Identity pools provide AWS credentials to grant your users access to other AWS services\. You can use user pools and identity pools separately or together\.
