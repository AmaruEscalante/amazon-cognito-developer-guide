# Application client\-based multi\-tenancy<a name="application-client-based-multi-tenancy"></a>

With application client\-based multi\-tenancy, you can map the same user to multiple tenants without the need to recreate a userâ€™s profile\. You can create an application client for each tenant and enable the tenant external IdP as the only allowed identity provider for this application client\. For more information see, [ Configuring a user pool app client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-app-idp-settings.html)\. 

Application client\-based multi\-tenancy requires additional considerations for user name, password, and more when you use hosted UI to authenticate users with native accounts\. When the hosted UI is in use, a session cookie is created to maintain the session for the authenticated user\. The session cookie also provides SSO between application clients in the same user pool\. This approach can be used in the following scenarios:
+ Your application has the same configurations across all tenants\. For example, data residency and password policy are the same across all tenants\.
+ Your application has a one\-to\-many mapping between user and tenants\. For example, a single user could have access to multiple tenants using the same profile\.
+ You have a federation\-only multi\-tenant application where tenants will always use an external IdP to sign in to your application\.
+ You have a B2B multi\-tenant application and tenants backend services will use client\-credentials grant to access your services\. In this case, you can create application client for each tenant and share the client\-id and secret with tenant backend service for machine\-to\-machine authentication\.

 **Effort level** 

The development effort to use this approach is high\. You need to implement tenant\-matching logic and a user interface to match a user to the application client for their tenant\.
